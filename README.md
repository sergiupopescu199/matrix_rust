A while ago I started to learn Go and I’m still doing but in meantime I really wanted to slowly start learning Rust, I really like this two languages! 

Go is an incredible language it’s a joy to code in but of course when I want raw speed Rust is my go to, I’m really afraid by C++ and Rust seems to be the best candidate not to replace (for now) but for the moment to compete with it. As always when I start to learn a new language after the theory I start with the Inverse Matrix program, there are some data structures and after doing this program I learned a lot. The borrow checker is a masterpiece the same is for the Rust compiler.

For for now I’ll focus to understand and learn Go and Rust wish me good luck!



This program generate an random matrix and after calculate it’s Inverse matrix, the values and the dimension of the matrix can be modified in the `main.rs` file.
